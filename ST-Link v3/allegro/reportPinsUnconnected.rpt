Report methodology:
  - Dangling lines have at least one end not connected.
  - Dangling vias have one or no connection
      - Plus are not a test, thieving or netshort property via.
  - Antenna vias do not have connections on their start and end layers.
      - Plus they are not a thieving vias.
      - Optionally, VOLTAGE nets, testvias and through vias can be suppressed with
        the environment variable report_antennavia.
      - Section may be suppressed by variable report_noantennavia.
  - Not part of the current partition.
  - To suppress items in dangle report add the OK_DANGLE property to the via
    or connect line.

<< Dangling Lines >>  - Location marked with a star (*) is dangling.

Notes:
Return Net is the return path net assigned to return path connections identified during creation of High Speed Via Structure.
Net Name does not include Return Net.
Each net assigned to structure is listed separately as a row for multi-net structures.
If a net has 2 or more connected structures, each structure instance is listed separately as a row for a given net.

Unused Blind/Buried Via Report

Wed Jul 24 16:10:54 2024

<b>Note:</b> This report identifies the unused B/B vias associated with a via stack structure. A stack structure can consist of coincidently placed micro, B/B vias or a combination. As an example of what the report detects, consider the stack Micro1-2, BB2-7, Micro7-8; if a trace connects to the stack on Layers 3 and 6, Micro1-2 and Micro7-8 would be identified as "unused".
