#	If you wish a different schedule output, copy this

#	change the filter item:
#         NET_STATUS = "SCHEDULED"
#         OR
#         NET_STATUS = "PARTIAL_SCHEDULE"
#       Then run the "report -v user_schedule <brd> <report>
#	or access the "User Schedule" report in Allegro.
#
# For example change it to --> VOLTAGE = ""
# will report the schedule of all nets on board except those with the
# VOLTAGE property.
